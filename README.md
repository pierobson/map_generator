# map_generator

This is an ongoing project to procedurally generate fantasy maps in an ancient, parchment style and in a more satellite, terrain-y style.

## Processing

The project will initially be written in the Processing language because its so easy to use.
The map generation will use the OpenSimplex Noise java library written by Kurt Spencer.

## TBD

After functionality has been implemented in Processing, if will be rewritten from the ground up in C (or Go) as more of a challenge to myself.
